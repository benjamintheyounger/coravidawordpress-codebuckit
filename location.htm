                supermarkets and stores for nearly anything you might need.. and for more advanced requests the city
                of San Jose is just a short 25 min flight from the Quepos airport, or a 3 hour drive.</p>

                        From the central Quepos, follow the 618 road towards Manuel Antonio. As you proceed out of
                        Quepos, the road bends sharply to the right and up hill. Turn left and you will see a
                        fountain and a yellow barrier. Once you are at the guard gate, ask for Villa Jacana or Villa
                        Manakin, they are side by side. If you have any trouble finding Manuel Antonio Estates just
                        ask a taxi driver in Quepos, They usually all know how to get there.
